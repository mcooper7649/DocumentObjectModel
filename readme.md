 ### Adding JavaScript to Websites
 ---

 1. Inline JavaScript like CSS is bad practice and should be avoided at all costs. | onload="codeGoeshere".
 2. Script Tag JS is | <script>alert("HELLO")</script>
 3. External JS like CSS can be connected using the example|    <script src="index.js" charset="utf-8"></script>   with a seperate file name injex.jx
 4. JS you want to add to the bottom of your html documment, vs the top like CSS.# DocumentObjectModel
