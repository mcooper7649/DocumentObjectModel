 # Introductions to the Document Object Model
 
 
 ### Adding JavaScript to Websites
 ---

 1. Inline JavaScript like CSS is bad practice and should be avoided at all costs. | onload="codeGoeshere".
 2. Script Tag JS is | <script>alert("HELLO")</script>
 3. External JS like CSS can be connected using the example|    <script src="index.js" charset="utf-8"></script>   with a seperate file name injex.jx
 4. JS you want to add to the bottom of your html documment, vs the top like CSS.# DocumentObjectModel

Getters Setters and Methods

1. Getter - car.color; //red; this gets the object color property
2. Setter - car.numberOfDoors = 0;  // This sets our car objects property numberOfDoors to 0
3. Method - car.drive(); // Calling the method will do something, drive in this instance, similiar to a function. A method is something an object can do so it has to be associated with an object!

2. Change the text from "Third" to "Mike"
